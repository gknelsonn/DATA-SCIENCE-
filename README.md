# Data Science Projects
# Overview
Welcome to my portfolio of work in data science and machine learning, which includes a number of projects that highlight my commitment to learning the Python programming language. As an AI engineer, I have a strong interest in machine learning and strive to offer creative and effective solutions. Every project demonstrates a dedication to efficiency, foundations, and the use of machine learning to address practical problems.

# Projects 
1. # Bengaluru House Prices Prediction
   This data science project explains in detail how to create a website that predicts real estate prices. First, we will use the Bangalore housing pricing dataset from Kaggle.com to create a model using Sklearn and linear regression. Writing a Python Flask server that serves http requests using the saved model would be the second stage. The third component is the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website that lets users enter details like bedrooms and the square footage of their home. It then calls a Python Flask server to get the estimated cost.
